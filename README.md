# TicTacToe

## System Dependencies

It includes both a game client program and a game server program; these two programs communicate with each other using self-implemented application-layer protocol, JAW. Two players can each run the client program to login to a game server and to play a game with each other.


### Running the Program
Start the server on a linux computer

```
python server.py
python player.py 127.0.0.1 2017
